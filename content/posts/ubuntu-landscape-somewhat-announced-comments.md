Yves,  
  
I'm responsible for the Landscape project within Canonical. First, apologies if this caught you off-guard and you feel it's disruptive to your project. We haven't announced Landscape before this because it wasn't ready, and we try very hard not to talk about things before they're ready. Otherwise it just comes across as fluff. Unfortunately, as you noted that makes them "secret" sometimes.  
  
Secondly, for all the reasons you noted (and that fact that this is an interesting problem area) I don't think Landscape should disrupt your project. It may be of interest (it may not be) for you to know that the Landscape client is free software so potentially you could use it in your system.  
  
It's quite true that Landscape is both a commercial service and proprietary. I hope you won't hold that against Ubuntu as the two things are separate. Ubuntu is Free Software and will always remain so.  
  
Canonical will develop services around Ubuntu to pay for our investment and that's what Landscape is about. I don't think we've ever hidden that we're a commercial business.

Steve,  
  
Thank you for your message. It made me feel warm inside. :-)  
  
Please note that my post is dated from May 2006. Indeed my words were a bit bitter, I can't hide that I felt sad at that time. Landscape was a surprise to me.  
  
It's clear to me now that Canonical was correct and coherent in working in this project in a "secret" way until it was ready. The NWU development has stalled for personal reasons and the release of Landscape would only work as an incentive. It's also good to know that the client software is open source, thank you for letting me know.  
  
I still think Canonical is one of the most admirable companies around. Merits of the people working there.  
  
Best regards
<hr />
