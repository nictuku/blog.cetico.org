By the way, I need to say that this dictionary is very limited so dont get too excited.

This post was super helpful to me (i managed to create a working Portuguese-English dictionary). I have one small problem: all the entries run together. But that is really a small problem. Thanks for the help!

I read about your adventure in MobileRead.  
  
In pyglossary, in the "Convert" tab, I choose "Read from format XDXF" and then "Write to format Tabfile (txt, dic)". Is this what you did?  
  
The resulting tab-delimited file has corrupted the entries by mixing them up.

Never mind. The dictionary I was trying to convert was malformed, both in XDXF and DCT.  
  
It was the Brazilian Portuguese > English, which I guess J. Beaman was also trying to convert. The Portuguese > English works beautifully, though.  
  
Thanks for your how-to!

They keep changing the URL of the XDXF dictionaries. Currently it's here:  
  
http://xdxf.revdanica.com/down/  
  
If they change again, search for \[startdict xdxf download\] at Google.

Just answered my own question. Even though the sample has German to English, that dictionary (Pocket Oxford Duden) is definitely only English to German. Waste of $9. :(

Hi Yve Junquera,  
  
I just bought a german-spanish dictionary thinking that I could use it in the Kindle. But no no. DRM is in the way.  
  
Could you please tell the dummies how to get rid of the DRM so it can used on the Kindle.  
  
Thanks a lot.

Thanks to everyone there is a torrent going around search "69 retail" which should give a German to English dictionary. But it doesn't the original seeder has also commented this. It seems like a GOOD! Mobi format German to English dictionary is proving very difficult to get hold of!!!!!!

Thank you!  
This post is super helpful for me. Thanks for the dictionary. Is there something better now. Perhaps that recognizes capitalized words? I have no words to describe how better this blog is.
