It's quite simple: google for "hydracefallus". It's a unique, misspelled word that only seems to appear in that book(and now in this blog). Obviously, downloading that book without paying is illegal, yet it's ironic that "Google Hacks" teaches just that kind of tricks.  
  
Many would agree that book should be also labeled "how to find pirated or innocently stored oreilly books on the web".
