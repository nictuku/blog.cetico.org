There is a detailed objective described in "2.212.4 Secure shell (SSH)" for LPI 202 called:  
  
"Usage of multiple connections from multiple hosts  
  
to guard against loss of connection to remote host following  
  
configuration changes"  
  
In case you are also wandering what that means, read the ControlMaster part of [ssh\_config(5)](http://man-wiki.net/index.php/5:ssh_config).  
  
Good luck on your LPI quest! :-)
